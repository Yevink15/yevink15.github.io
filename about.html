    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
  I’m actively involved in collegiate gaming events, capturing tournament photography. I also serve as the Valorant Manager at GMU Esports, helping coordinate team operations and competitive play at the collegiate level.
    </p>

    <p>
Professionally, I work as a Systems Engineer at Northrop Grumman. Outside of engineering, I photograph esports tournaments and sports events in my free time, focusing on documenting real competitive moments and delivering edits with a fast turnaround.
